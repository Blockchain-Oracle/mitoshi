## List verified tokens

`GET /v1/verified-tokens`

Returns Tempo’s curated verified TIP-20 tokens.

### Query parameters

### Responses

#### `200`: The curated verified TIP-20 tokens.

Headers:

- `RateLimit-Limit` `integer`: How many requests you may make in the current time window. Not sent on cached responses or `402` payment challenges.

- `tempo-request-id` `string`: A unique id for this request, returned on every response (and as `requestId` in error bodies). Include it when contacting support so we can find your request.

Body (`application/json`):

- `data` `object[]` _(required)_: The curated verified TIP-20 tokens.
  - `address` `string` _(required)_: The TIP-20 token contract address on Tempo.
  - `currency` `string` _(required)_: The currency label for this token, such as `USD` for USD-denominated stablecoins.

### Query parameters

- `chainId` `string | number`: Which Tempo network to query. Use the alias `mainnet` or `testnet`, or a numeric chain id. Defaults to `mainnet` when omitted.

### Responses

#### `200`: One verified TIP-20 token from Tempo’s curated list.

Headers:

- `RateLimit-Limit` `integer`: How many requests you may make in the current time window. Not sent on cached responses or `402` payment challenges.
- `RateLimit-Remaining` `integer`: How many requests you have left in the current window before you are rate-limited. Not sent on cached responses or `402` payment challenges.
- `RateLimit-Reset` `integer`: When the current window resets, as a Unix timestamp in seconds. Not sent on cached responses or `402` payment challenges.
- `RateLimit-Scope` `string`: Which quota this request counted against (e.g. `data:read`). Not sent on cached responses or `402` payment challenges.
- `tempo-request-id` `string`: A unique id for this request, returned on every response (and as `requestId` in error bodies). Include it when contacting support so we can find your request.

Body (`application/json`):

- `address` `string` _(required)_: The TIP-20 token contract address on Tempo.
- `currency` `string` _(required)_: The currency label for this token, such as `USD` for USD-denominated stablecoins.
- `decimals` `integer` _(required)_: The number of decimal places the token uses; Tempo stablecoins typically use 6.
- `logoUri` `string <uri>`: The curated HTTPS URL for this token’s logo image, when one is set.

    - `message` `string` _(required)_: A specific thing that went wrong, in plain language (e.g. why a field failed validation).
    - `path` `string | number[]`: Where the problem is, as a path into your request (e.g. `["query", "limit"]`). Present for validation errors.
  - `message` `string` _(required)_: A human-readable explanation of what went wrong.

#### `402`: Payment required. This endpoint accepts MPP payment, and the request either exceeded free quota or needs a paid request credential. The challenge is protocol-native (handled by mppx), not the JSON error envelope: read the `WWW-Authenticate` header and retry with `Authorization: Payment <credential>`. A successful paid response carries `Payment-Receipt`.

# Balances

How much of each token an account holds.

## List address balances

`GET /v1/addresses/{address}/balances`

Lists how much of each TIP-20 token an account holds, ordered from largest to smallest balance. Amounts are returned in raw base units and human-readable form. Pass `valuation.currency` to include nominal values.

### Path parameters

- `address` `string` _(required)_: The account address whose token balances you want to list.

### Query parameters

- `chainId` `string | number`: Which Tempo network to query. Use the alias `mainnet` or `testnet`, or a numeric chain id. Defaults to `mainnet` when omitted.
- `currency` `string`: Only include verified tokens denominated in this currency (e.g. `USD`). Case-insensitive. Implies `verified=true` because the balances snapshot does not store currency for unverified tokens. Unknown currency strings are accepted but match no rows.
- `cursor` `string`: Opaque keyset cursor from a previous response (`nextCursor`); pass it back verbatim to fetch the next page. Omit for the first (head) page.
- `feeEligible` `boolean`: When `true`, include only tokens eligible to pay transaction fees on Tempo: verified tokens preferred by an active validator or backed by a liquid pool against one, plus the default fee token (`pathUSD`).
- `include` `string[]`: Comma-separated optional resources to embed, e.g. `totalCount`.
- `limit` `integer`: How many items to return per page (5–50, default 10). Use `nextCursor` to fetch more.
- `page` `integer`: Page number, 1-indexed (positional pagination for page-numbered access; `page=1` is the head page). Mutually exclusive with `cursor`, and `page × limit` must be at most 500 rows — use cursor pagination for deeper traversal. Pages are positional, so rows arriving at the head of a live feed can shift page contents.
- `valuation.currency` `string`: When present, include each holding’s nominal value in this denomination. Case-insensitive and must be priced by the configured FX oracle.
- `verified` `boolean`: When `true`, include only tokens from Tempo’s curated verified token list.

### Responses

#### `200`: A page of token balances for this account.

Headers:

- `RateLimit-Limit` `integer`: How many requests you may make in the current time window. Not sent on cached responses or `402` payment challenges.
- `RateLimit-Remaining` `integer`: How many requests you have left in the current window before you are rate-limited. Not sent on cached responses or `402` payment challenges.
- `RateLimit-Reset` `integer`: When the current window resets, as a Unix timestamp in seconds. Not sent on cached responses or `402` payment challenges.
- `RateLimit-Scope` `string`: Which quota this request counted against (e.g. `data:read`). Not sent on cached responses or `402` payment challenges.
- `tempo-request-id` `string`: A unique id for this request, returned on every response (and as `requestId` in error bodies). Include it when contacting support so we can find your request.

Body (`application/json`):

- `data` `object[]` _(required)_: The balances in this page, ordered from largest to smallest amount.
  - `amount` `string` _(required)_: A non-negative whole number, given as a decimal string so very large token amounts keep full precision. Expressed in the smallest unit of the token.
  - `currency` `string` _(required)_: The currency label for this balance, such as `USD` for a USD-denominated token.
  - `decimals` `integer` _(required)_: The number of decimal places used to convert this balance between base units and human-readable form.
  - `feeEligible` `boolean`: Whether this token can be used to pay transaction fees on Tempo: `true` when the token is verified and preferred by an active validator or backed by a liquid pool against one, or is the default fee token (`pathUSD`). Omitted when the lookup is unavailable.
  - `formatted` `string` _(required)_: The same balance in human-readable decimal form, using this balance’s `decimals`.
  - `id` `string` _(required)_: A stable resource ID for this balance, equal to the token contract address.
  - `token` `object` _(required)_: A compact token reference, returned when you request `include=token`.
    - `address` `string` _(required)_: The TIP-20 token contract address on Tempo.
    - `currency` `string` _(required)_: The currency label for this token, such as `USD` for USD-denominated stablecoins.
    - `decimals` `integer` _(required)_: The number of decimal places the token uses; Tempo stablecoins typically use 6.
    - `id` `string` _(required)_: A stable resource ID for this token, equal to its contract address.
    - `logoUri` `string`: A URL for the token’s logo image, when one is available.
    - `name` `string` _(required)_: The token’s human-readable name.
    - `symbol` `string` _(required)_: The short ticker symbol wallets and apps show for this token.
    - `verified` `boolean` _(required)_: Whether this token is in Tempo’s curated verified token list.
  - `valuation` `object`: The holding’s nominal value when `valuation.currency` is requested, or `null` when the token is unverified, its display currency has no rate, or rates were unavailable.
    - `amount` `string` _(required)_: The holding’s nominal value, as a decimal string in `currency`.
    - `currency` `string` _(required)_: The denomination currency of this value.
- `meta` `object`: Page-level resources: opt-in counts and valuation rate provenance.
  - `valuation` `object`: Rate provenance for leg valuations. Present when conversion rates were consulted; absent when every value was identity-valued or rates were unavailable.
    - `asOf` `string <date-time>` _(required)_: Publication date of the rate set as an ISO 8601 timestamp.
    - `basis` `string` _(required)_: Valuation basis: one token unit counts as one unit of its display currency.
    - `source` `string` _(required)_: FX rate oracle that supplied the conversion rates.
  - `totalCount` `integer`: Number of rows matching the query, exact when `totalCountCapped` is false and a lower bound (at least this many, computed up to 10000) when `totalCountCapped` is true. Independent of pagination: use `nextCursor` to page, not this count.
  - `totalCountCapped` `boolean`: Whether `totalCount` hit the count cap. When true, `totalCount` is a lower bound rather than an exact total.
- `nextCursor` `string` _(required)_: Pass this back as the `cursor` query parameter to fetch the next page. `null` once you have reached the end of the list.

Body (`application/json`):

- `error` `object` _(required)_: What went wrong.
  - `code` `string` _(required)_: A short, stable code you can branch on in your code (e.g. `token_not_found`).

#### `402`: Payment required. This endpoint accepts MPP payment, and the request either exceeded free quota or needs a paid request credential. The challenge is protocol-native (handled by mppx), not the JSON error envelope: read the `WWW-Authenticate` header and retry with `Authorization: Payment <credential>`. A successful paid response carries `Payment-Receipt`.

Headers:

    - `message` `string` _(required)_: A specific thing that went wrong, in plain language (e.g. why a field failed validation).
    - `path` `string | number[]`: Where the problem is, as a path into your request (e.g. `["query", "limit"]`). Present for validation errors.
  - `message` `string` _(required)_: A human-readable explanation of what went wrong.
- `requestId` `string` _(required)_: The id of this request — include it when contacting support.

#### `429`: Rate limit exceeded. On endpoints that accept MPP, over-quota unpaid requests return `402 Payment Required` instead.

Headers:

- `RateLimit-Limit` `integer`: How many requests you may make in the current time window. Not sent on cached responses or `402` payment challenges.

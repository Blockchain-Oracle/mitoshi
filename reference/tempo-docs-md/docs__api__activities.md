# Activities

A readable feed of what an account did onchain.

## List address activities

`GET /v1/addresses/{address}/activities`

Get a human-readable feed of what an address has been doing onchain, including payments sent and received, swaps, approvals, and more.

### Path parameters

- `address` `string` _(required)_: Account address whose activity you want to list.

### Query parameters

- `amount.from` `string`: Only include activities with at least one token amount greater than or equal to this base-unit quantity.
- `amount.to` `string`: Only include activities with at least one token amount less than or equal to this base-unit quantity.
- `chainId` `string | number`: Which Tempo network to query. Use the alias `mainnet` or `testnet`, or a numeric chain id. Defaults to `mainnet` when omitted.
- `cursor` `string`: Opaque keyset cursor from a previous response (`nextCursor`); pass it back verbatim to fetch the next page. Omit for the first (head) page.
- `group` `boolean`: Set to `true` to fold consecutive items signed by the same access key on the same UTC day into `group` entries. Defaults to `false`, which returns every item separately.
- `include` `string[]`: Comma-separated activity options. `zones` combines the selected parent chain with every readable Zone.
- `limit` `integer`: How many items to return per page (5–50, default 10). Use `nextCursor` to fetch more.
- `logs` `boolean`: Set to `true` to attach each item’s full transaction log set (decoded when possible) as a top-level `events` array, so no co-located log is hidden. Defaults to `false`. `unknown` items always include it.
- `recipient` `string`: Only include activities sent to this recipient address.
- `sender` `string`: Only include activities sent from this sender address.
- `token` `string`: Only include activities with a source, destination, or refund token for this TIP-20 contract.
- `type` `string[]`: Only include these activity types, such as `transfer,swap`. Multiple values use OR semantics.
- `valuation.amount.from` `string`: Only include activities with at least one valued amount greater than or equal to this amount. Requires `valuation.currency`.
- `valuation.amount.to` `string`: Only include activities with at least one valued amount less than or equal to this amount. Requires `valuation.currency`.
- `valuation.currency` `string`: Currency to denominate values in (case-insensitive, e.g. `AUD`). Must be priced by the configured FX oracle.

### Responses

#### `200`: A page of address activity entries.

Headers:

# MPP

Submit completed MPP credentials to Tempo. Validate checks a credential without settling it; Broadcast validates, screens, and submits it. Both require `mpp:write`.

## Validate MPP credential

`POST /v1/mpp/validate`

Checks whether a completed MPP credential can be processed without submitting payment.

Tempo validates the challenge and credential, confirms the chain is supported, and screens the payment parties. It does not settle, broadcast, reserve funds, or consume the credential.

Requires `mpp:write` and, for Zones, `zone:<chainId>:read` or `zone:<chainId>:write`. Well-formed requests return HTTP `200`; inspect `success`. Invalid bodies return `400`; missing or unauthorized API keys return `401` or `403`.

  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({

## Broadcast MPP credential

`POST /v1/mpp/broadcast`

Validates, screens, and submits a completed MPP credential to Tempo.

Requires `mpp:write` and, for Zones, `zone:<chainId>:write`. Well-formed requests return HTTP `200`; inspect `success`.

Use `Idempotency-Key` on retries to replay a successful receipt. Reusing a key for a different credential returns `invalid_payment`, and in-flight duplicates return `temporarily_unavailable`.

### Header parameters

- `Idempotency-Key` `string`: Optional opaque retry key, scoped to the API key and credential. Reusing it after a successful broadcast returns the original receipt without another submission. Reusing it with a different credential returns `invalid_payment`. While the first request is running, duplicates return `temporarily_unavailable`. Failed attempts are not retained and may be retried with the same key.

### Request body (required) (`application/json`)

- `challenge` `object` _(required)_: An MPP payment challenge.
  - `description` `string`: A human-readable description of the payment.
  - `expires` `string`: When the payment challenge expires, as an ISO-8601 timestamp.
  - `id` `string` _(required)_: The payment challenge identifier.
